• Built and evaluated Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers, achieved 82% accuracy
• Conducted chi-square tests and t-tests to determine statistically significant correlations 
• Identified key risk factors including serum creatinine, age and ejection fraction
• Interpreted model coefficients and correlations to assess the clinical relevance of predictors and explain model behavior
